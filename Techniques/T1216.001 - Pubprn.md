Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. PubPrn.vbs is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script is signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the Windows Command Shell via `Cscript.exe`. For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: `cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com`.
