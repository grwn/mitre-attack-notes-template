# LSA Secrets

Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets`. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.
