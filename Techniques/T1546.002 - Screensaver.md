# Screensaver

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension. The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in `C:\Windows\System32\`, and `C:\Windows\sysWOW64\` on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.
