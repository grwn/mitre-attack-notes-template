Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named `March 25 \u202Excod.scr` will display as `March 25 rcs.docx`. A JavaScript file named `photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js` will be displayed as `photo_high_resj.png`.
