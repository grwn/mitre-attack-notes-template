Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via the `python.exe` interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.
