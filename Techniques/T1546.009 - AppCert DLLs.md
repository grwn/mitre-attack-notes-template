# AppCert DLLs

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the `AppCertDLLs` Registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\` are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functions `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLoginW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`.
