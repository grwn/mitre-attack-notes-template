# Cron

Adversaries may abuse the `cron` utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `cron` utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The `crontab` file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any `crontab` files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.
