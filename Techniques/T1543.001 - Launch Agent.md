Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/Library/LaunchAgents`, and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Property list files use the `Label`, `ProgramArguments` , and `RunAtLoad` keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.
