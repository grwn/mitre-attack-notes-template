# Emond

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a Launch Daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at `/sbin/emond` will load any rules from the `/etc/emond.d/rules/` directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.
