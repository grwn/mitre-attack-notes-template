Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to store user account information including password hashes in `/etc/shadow`. By default, `/etc/shadow` is only readable by the root user.
