# Logon Script (Windows)

Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. This is done via adding a path to a script to the `HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript`Registry key.
