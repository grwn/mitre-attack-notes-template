Adversaries may modify the SSH `authorized_keys` file to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The `authorized_keys` file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under `<user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Users may edit the systemâ€™s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value "yes" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
