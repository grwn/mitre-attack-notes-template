# Elevated Execution with Prompt

Adversaries may leverage the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials. The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.
