Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is `pam_unix.so`, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in `/etc/passwd`and `/etc/shadow`.
